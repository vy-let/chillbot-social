The Chillbot Social License
-------------------------------------------

This license is intended to provide software writers a way of publishing their work open-source, with some measure of protection against it being used by bad actors or in ways which run counter to building and maintaining a healthy and free society.

It is meant to protect your software against being used to aid in discrimination or wide data collection, as well as its use by the military, police, and for-profit companies.

The text of the license (found in `License.txt`) itself is public domain. If you adapt it, you are encouraged to change the name of your version, and change who is trusted to publish new versions, to avoid confusion.

I am not a lawyer, and I cannot claim for sure whether this license will be effective in the ways I intend it to be. It is merely provided in hopes that it will be useful to others, but, of course, I don't guarantee it will be. It is a work in progress and I welcome any good-faith contributions.
